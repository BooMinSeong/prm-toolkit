On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.  On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard.  Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?",

    "problem": "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}. A cylindrical water tank has a radius of 3 meters and a height of 8 meters. If water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 2 cubic meters per minute, how long will it take to fill the tank completely from empty? Use π ≈ 3.14159.",
    "response": "To find how long it takes to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the volume of the cylindrical tank. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\nGiven that the radius r = 3 meters and the height h = 8 meters, we can substitute these values into the formula: V = π × 3² × 8.\nCalculating the radius squared: 3² = 9. So the formula becomes V = π × 9 × 8 = 72π cubic meters.\nUsing the approximation π ≈ 3.14159, we calculate: V = 72 × 3.14159 = 226.19448 cubic meters. For practical purposes, we can round this to approximately 226.19 cubic meters.\nNow we know the tank's volume is approximately 226.19 cubic meters, and water is being pumped in at a rate of 2 cubic meters per minute. To find the time needed, we divide the total volume by the pumping rate.\nTime = Volume ÷ Rate = 226.19 ÷ 2 = 113.095 minutes.\nWe can express this more precisely: if we keep more decimal places, 72π ÷ 2 = 36π ≈ 113.097 minutes.\nTo convert this to hours and minutes for better understanding: 113.097 minutes = 1 hour and 53.097 minutes, or approximately 1 hour and 53 minutes.\nTherefore, it will take approximately 113.1 minutes, or about 36π minutes if we want an exact expression. The answer is \\boxed{36\\pi} minutes, or approximately \\boxed{113.1} minutes.To find how long it takes to fill the tank, we first need to calculate the volume of the cylindrical tank. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\nGiven that the radius r = 3 meters and the height h = 8 meters, we can substitute these values into the formula: V = π × 3² × 8.\nCalculating the radius squared: 3² = 9. So the formula becomes V = π × 9 × 8 = 72π cubic meters.\nUsing the approximation π ≈ 3.14159, we calculate: V = 72 × 3.14159 = 226.19448 cubic meters. For practical purposes, we can round this to approximately 226.19 cubic meters.\nNow we know the tank's volume is approximately 226.19 cubic meters, and water is being pumped in at a rate of 2 cubic meters per minute.

The 8 terms are: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640.\nSumming these terms: 5 + 10 = 15, 15 + 20 = 35, 35 + 40 = 75, 75 + 80 = 155, 155 + 160 = 315, 315 + 320 = 635, 635 + 640 = 1275.\nThis confirms our formula-based calculation. The sum of the first 8 terms is 1275.\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1275}.A geometric sequence has the form a, ar, ar², ar³, ..., where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. In this problem, a = 5 and r = 2.\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is Sₙ = a(rⁿ - 1)/(r - 1), when r ≠ 1. We need to find S₈.\nSubstituting the values into the formula: S₈ = 5(2⁸ - 1)/(2 - 1) = 5(2⁸ - 1)/1 = 5(2⁸ - 1).\nNow we need to calculate 2⁸. Let's compute this step by step: 2¹ = 2, 2² = 4, 2³ = 8, 2⁴ = 16, 2⁵ = 32, 2⁶ = 64, 2⁷ = 128, 2⁸ = 256.\nTherefore, S₈ = 5(256 - 1) = 5 × 255 = 1275.\nLet's verify this by calculating the terms individually and summing them. The 8 terms are: 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640.\nSumming these terms: 5 + 10 = 15, 15 + 20 = 35, 35 + 40 = 75, 75 + 80 = 155, 155 + 160 = 315, 315 + 320 = 635, 635 + 640 = 1275.\nThis confirms our formula-based calculation. The sum of the first 8 terms is 1275.\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{1275}."
